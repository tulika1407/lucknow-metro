(This project is for finding shortest path between two path in lucknow metro.)
Introducing the Lucknow Metro Shortest Path Finder project! This web application has been created to assist Lucknow commuters in discovering the most efficient route between two locations within the Lucknow Metro network. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the quickest route and the associated fare for your travel.

# Features

Efficient Path Computation: This application harnesses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the most efficient route between the chosen stations, ensuring you reach your destination with as few stops as possible.

Fare Calculation: In addition to identifying the shortest path, our tool also computes the fare for your journey, factoring in the number of stations traversed and the distance covered.

Interactive Metro Map: Explore the Lucknow Metro system using our interactive map, enabling you to locate stations and plan your routes with ease.

Real-Time Updates: Stay well-informed with real-time information regarding station closures, delays, and other critical alerts to enhance your commuting experience.

# technology used

HTML: The structure of our web application is built using HTML to create a user-friendly interface.

CSS: CSS is used for styling to make the application visually appealing and easy to navigate.

JavaScript: We've implemented Dijkstra's algorithm in JavaScript to calculate the shortest path between stations and perform fare calculations.

Interactive Map: The interactive map is powered by JavaScript libraries to provide a dynamic and informative user experience.
